v1.0.1 (2011-08-01)
roxygen edits, (especially which.package)
v1.0.2 (2011-08-25)
updates to updateR.sh to handle Rd files beginning with dot
dropped lazyload as per R 2.13
v1.0.3
bug fix where Rd's weren't moved to tmpdir
added a warning if there are hidden .Rd files detected
removed all code that tried to backup the .Rd files (but gave errors if there were no hidden .Rd's)
robust backup/restore during roxygen, include Rd files starting with dot
v1.0.4
added --vanilla flag to all R CMD's, thereby avoiding reading the .Rprofile
edit.func.R: wrapped package name in quotes in the final cat(sprintf( command
relibrary: wrote recursive version of loaded.dependencies.
unlibrary:
- unload packages using the updated unlibrary
- simplified & using detach
- This still doesn't get around the dreaded error: 
  "Error in fetch(key) : internal error -3 in R_decompress1"
- According to Ripley's reply, it's impossible to do so:
  (http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Unable-to-reload-Rdoc-td4333063.html)
  "This is simply not supported.  Lazy-load databases are cached, and you
  cannot expect to change them during the R session once they have been used."
v1.0.5 (2012-03-16)
added -x, --no-examples option
more careful escaping of '%' characters
added detach.all
added -t flag
auto-update Date field
added unescapedPercentWarning
